//! Example 5 runner.
//!
//! This app runs a measurement on the actual system and runs the same measurement in symex.
//! The goal for this application is show that, although safe, the estimations provided by symex
//! for the `m7` architechture is quite inprecise.
//!
//! ## Binary assumptions
//!
//! This assumes that there exists a function *meaure* in the binary and that this function is, at
//! some point, called by the main function.
//!
//! ## For the interested student:
//!
//! 1. Why do you think that the cycle estimates are this inaccurate?
//! 2. Try compiling for a cortexm0 processor (ARMv6-M) and run the same test.
//!     2.1. Were the results similar?
//!     2.2  Why do you think that is?
